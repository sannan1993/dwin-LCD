\section{Preparing a SD card}

We have used 32GB SD card for development. we first make a partition then make a 4GB volume using disk management.Then we format the card using fat32 file system and we will make 4kb sectors, as shown in the figure below.\\

\emph{\textit{Note: For 16GB card we dont have to make 4GB volume. We can directly make 4kb sector in format}}

%this is how to go on new page

\section{How to insert image in DGUS}

First open the software (DGUS\_V5.08.exe) then make a new project (or open existing one), then inset the image using the plus sign at the left of the software interface. Then press "Save" button, then press "Generate" button (these button are present on the home tab of the top bar)

\emph{\textit{Note: We recommend that image should be in bmp format. since we are facing some issues in 16bit so we are making images in 24bit format (windows)}}

\section{How to Receive \& Send data Serially in DGUS}

We can send data to MCU using "Status sync return", which Return different data to the VP/UART/Register during Press, Continuous press, Loosen press. 

Return Mode: 0x00 means no data return;
\begin{itemize}
\item 0x01 means return the data to the VP
\item 0x02 means return the data to the UART
\item 0x03 means return the data to the Register/System Variables interface
\end{itemize}
                         
For T5L series, only have 0x01 mode, but could support VP, UART, Register/ System Variables interface together\\

 
\emph{Note: If LCD supports RS485 then use Max485 to convert data to Rx or Tx.}
\begin{figure}[!htb] %[!htb] is used to place image where it is in editor
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{statusSync} 
	\caption{Status Sync Return.\\}
\end{figure}

We can use "Return key code" to set the value in the Data variable. we van also use button effect and jump to.\\

For data to send serially insert the configuration file "CONFIG.TXT" in the DWIN\_SET folder.\\ \\
Paste the following in the CONFIG.TXT file\\ \\
R1=07 ; Baud rate, 0x07: 115200bps.\\
R2=20 ; SYS\_CFG, enable sleep mode if no operation.\\
R6=40 ; Brightness of backlight, 0x40: 100\% brightness.\\
R7=10 ; Brightness of backlight of sleep mode, 0x10: 25\% brightness.\\
R8=14 ; Light-up time,units: 1.0 seconds,0x14=20 seconds.\\
R3=A5 ; High-byte of frame header: 0xA5.\\
RA=5A ; Low-byte of frame header: 0x5A.\\
STOP\_DWIN\_OS; \\

For sending the data to LCD (DGUS) we use the following command.\\

{\huge 0xa55a058200000010\\}


We can send the command using termite.\\ 
\emph{Note: Following setting need to be done in termite for sending the data. we send the data as shown in the figure.}

\section{How to insert keyboard in DGUS}
Insert text display, where you want to show the text. Also insert text input on top of the text display. insert following settings.

\begin{itemize}
\item Data Auto Upload
\item Insert the vp address (vp address of text input should be same as the text display)
\item input mode: Re-open
\item text lenght: 10
\item Click Keyboard Settings. (to select the keyboard image)
\item clipping rectangle will be used to crop the keyboard.
\item paste location can be same as first coordinate.
\item in the keyboard diagram, make basic touch for buttons.
\end{itemize}

"Text input" parameters is shown in the below figure.
